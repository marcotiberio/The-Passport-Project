  <meta name="description" content="We live in a world divided by borders and walls where something as
        ephemeral as a piece of paper, a document, or a passport can acquire the
        potency of a curse that feels like it cannot be broken. Struggling to
        claim basic rights like self-determination and freedom of movement,
        refugees come to experience the passport not as a symbol of identity and
        pride, but as a source of angst. With this project, I turn my camera
        on my own story, to create personal reportage depicting themes of
        displacement, asylum, and integration." />

          <div>
            A while ago, I heard that scientists invented a medicine, which makes one forget painful memories. I was
            charmed by the idea. I took a long and hard look at my life, trying to figure out which memories are worth
            keeping and what I want to forget. Initially, I was not thinking of war at all, not believing that any
            medicine could ever take those memories away. But then again: What if? Would I want the days I had walked on
            shattered window glass through my city Sana’a, Yemen to be erased?
            <br><br>
            I decided to make this project to figure out how things happened, to figure out the war, the escape, the
            transition and the unfamiliar. It is not easy to talk about trauma while you are living it because you do
            not recognize it. Creating this work enabled me to tackle the trauma and confront it. It serves as a healing
            method to register my emotions during the transition to the unknown.
            <br><br>
            During the wait your mind does not stop thinking; you are angry and bitter, lonely and abandoned. You wake
            up in the morning and put a smile on your face the same way you put on your socks before you head out. I
            needed a distraction from this storm that hurt the mind. Photography is a beautiful distraction, and it has
            a quality in organizing the chaos. It makes cruelty look alright and that is what I love about it.
            Throughout this book, my depiction of the world tends to be melancholic and a way to create my own light in
            the dark. I recorded and documented my physical and emotional surroundings, which become a habit of mine as
            a witness and observer. Photography functioned as a mediator to realize the truth in the harsh reality of
            the present.
            <br><br>
            This is real<br>
            The war is real<br>
            My departure from Yemen is real<br>
            Leaving my family behind is real<br>
            The resettlement in The Netherlands is real<br>
            Moving from one place to another is real<br>
            My clothes that no longer hold smells familiar to me are real<br>
            My Syrian roommate who attempted to cross the Turkish border five times is real<br>
            My Kurdish roommate who sings in the shower is real<br>
            This sorrowful song she plays in the room repeatedly is real<br>
            All this noise in the world is real<br>
            The colors of the autumn Dutch landscape are beautiful and real<br>
            This cold is real<br>
            This pause for a normal life and vibrant bouquets of dreams is real<br>
            This pain here is real.<br>
            <br><br>
            The process of documenting the experience of asylum is never linear. I remain between the past I left behind
            and my future in a new country. In May 2019, I flew back to the Markazi refugee camp, the world’s only
            refugee camp for Yemenis in Djibouti where Yemeni refugees are currently stranded. I was one of the lucky
            ones who made it safety, while many still have not. I remember people sharing photos brought from home and
            how memories from a seemingly distant past flooded into the space. Birthday parties, weddings, children
            playing and social gatherings were all spread out in front of us. It transported me back home. It was the
            closest I could get to Yemen at that point, I wanted to document our collective trauma and memories.
            <br><br>
            Throughout this journey, I took on many roles, I am the storyteller, the photographer and the person who has
            gone through these experiences. It is empowering to tell your own story to the world. It is liberating. I
            was not alone and so I hoped to visually articulate people’s struggle to leave countries where conditions of
            violence, war and aggression are prevalent. I focused on reflections of personal moments including
            handwritten testimonies that capture the hopes, fears, dreams and struggle.
            <br><br>
            Stories of migration and displacement are complex. There is no one single narrative. We undergo a lot of
            changes and our identity reflects that. As a refugee, you have to confront this new label that can affect
            the process of identity reformation; something we never had to consider while living in our country of
            origin. However, beyond the labels, I wanted to offer my own version of the story, one that is infused with
            my resilient spirit, unbroken, unfailing and devoid of self-pity. I wanted to climb the fences, and I did.

            <p>
              Calling on my own experience, this book reflects on notions of freedom
              and the struggle to leave a country where violence, war, and aggression
              are prevalent. Through portraits, images of daily life, personal reflections,
              and handwritten testimonies, I aim to show the unpredictable, transitory, and
              restricted nature of our lives.

            It doesn’t matter if it is Saturday or Monday, or if it’s 7:00 a.m. or 9:00 p.m.
            Days look similar and so does the time. What matters is that each night and around
            10:00 p.m., we know that our names will be listed for either a transfer, another
            hearing, or for any other purpose. People wait restlessly anxious about what comes next.”

          <p>“’What did you take with you when you left Yemen?’I asked. ‘I took my documents, some
            clothes and some pain. Then the boat sank, the few clothes we brought were gone. What I
            rescued was my family, the documents and the pain’. In a failed attempt to wipe his sweat,
            he used his NGO commercial shirt and wiped his tears instead. His face was my sad song. I
            looked at his children. I’ve always been intrigued about how children react when their parents
            sob. I never liked seeing my mom in tears when I was a child. My bets are, they didn’t either..."
