# The Passport Project ðŸ“¸ Thana Faroq

We live in a world divided by borders and walls where something as ephemeral as a piece of paper, a document, or a passport can acquire the potency of a curse that feels like it cannot be broken. Struggling to claim basic rights like self-determination and freedom of movement, refugees come to experience the passport not as a symbol of identity and pride, but as a source of angst. With this project, I turn my camera on my own story, to create personal reportage depicting themes of displacement, asylum, and integration.

Calling on my own experience, I reflect on notions of freedom and the struggle to leave a country where violence, war, and aggression are prevalent. Through portraits, images of daily life, personal reflections, and handwritten testimonies, I aim to capture the hopes, fears, dreams, and isolation felt by refugees and show the unpredictable, transitory, and restricted nature of our lives. The project is executed between the UK, Netherlands and around the borders of Djibouti with Yemen.
